Student 1: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the

Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

For each of the first three faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insertPath()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_newNode()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_unlinkParentToChild()
===============================================================

bdtBad4 and bdtBad5 are optional extra credit:

For bdtBad4, you do not have to find the bug. Instead, indicate what
is the fundamental difference with trying to debug this executable in
gdb versus the first three:

The difference between this one and the others is that for the first
three, there was either an error that only showed itself manifested in
one group of print outs or simply showed that the program stopped
working at a specific line. For this one, not only did it show an error
in 2 different groups of outputs, but the issue was that it printed out
a set of values that weren't in the possible temps. Another difference
was that when trying to print (temp = BDT_toString() in the areas where
there were bugs, it printed out a\na/b\n...etc. which seemed right, but
when running the whole program, it was printed something entirely
different (0^ACa). The error didn't manifest itself into all printouts
of temp. We were able to debug this program by comparing it to the
previous 3 since we knew which parts had errors in the previous ones
finding that it was in BDT_toString().


For bdtBad5, you do not have to find the bug. Instead, indicate one
hypothesis for how the program could crash within the DynArray module,
which we promise is itself correct:

Running bdtBad5 indicates that an assertion error occurs in the
function BDT_strlenAccumulate, because the given string pointer is
NULL. This could cause DynArray to crash if the DynArray_map module is
passed the BDT_strlenAccumulate function, and the DynArray object it
operates on contains NULL string pointers, which would initiate the
same error since the NULL string pointers in the DynArray object will
be passed into BDT_strlenAccumulate.

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
